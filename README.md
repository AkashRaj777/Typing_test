# Typing speed test
The Typing Speed Test project is a comprehensive software application designed to help users evaluate and enhance their typing speed and accuracy through an engaging and interactive interface. Developed using Python (Spyder IDE) and MySQL, the system provides a seamless experience that caters to both beginners and advanced users seeking to monitor and improve their typing proficiency.

Upon registration, users can securely log in to access personalized features. The core functionality involves presenting users with randomly generated sentences, typically around 15 words, which they must type as accurately and quickly as possible. The system automatically records the start and end times of each test, calculating the user's typing speed in words per minute (WPM) and accuracy percentage immediately after completion. These statistics are stored in a database, allowing users to track their progress over time.

A standout feature of the project is its graphical analysis module. By clicking the "Graph" button, users can visualize their historical typing speed and accuracy through intuitive bar charts, providing motivation and insight into their improvement trajectory. The application also includes a clear set of user instructions and an easy-to-navigate interface, ensuring accessibility for all age groups.

Additional functionalities include options to repeat the test, clear results, and exit the application conveniently. The project is designed to run on both Windows and Mac systems, requiring only basic hardware and pre-installed Python libraries. Future enhancements could introduce features such as pausing tests, multiplayer modes, advanced security, and error highlighting for a richer user experience.

Overall, the Typing Speed Test project serves as a valuable tool for anyone aiming to boost their typing skills, offering immediate feedback, progress tracking, and a user-friendly environment that encourages continual improvement
